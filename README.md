# Spam-Detection-Using-Support-Vector-Machine
Course 532 Final Project

In this project, the concept and background of Support Vector Machine(SVM) will be introduced to the students who are interested in machine learning. SVM is a supervised machine learning model and is a powerful tool to solve many real-world classification problems. Students will have a chance to mathematically understand the process of classifying the data by maximizing the margin in both linear problems and non-linear problems. Then a hands-on SVM problem related to spam detection will be given to students, which makes this project unique and interesting. Students are required to identify the bag of words correlated to spam emails. The well-designed warm-ups will help students to gradually prepare themselves and eventually solve this real-world problem using kernel tricks. Also, the students will have a glimpse at dual representation and kernelâ€™s relation, and know what else kernel based SVM is capable of. After completing the exercises, students will understand the concepts of SVM in-depth and have a taste of using the techniques in practice.
